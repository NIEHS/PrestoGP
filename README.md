# Overview

PrestoGP is an R package for scalable penalized regression on spatio-temporal outcomes using Gaussian processes. The package includes the methods described in the paper "Scalable penalized spatiotemporal land-use regression for ground-level nitrogen dioxide" by Messier and Katzfuss (2020). The package is designed to handle big data and is useful for large-scale geospatial exposure assessment and geophysical modeling. PrestoGP expands the methods in Messier and Katzfuss (2020) to include the following important feature:

1. Multivariate spatiotemporal outcomes using multivariate Matern Gaussian process. The method is described in the paper "A valid Mat√©rn class of cross-covariance functions for multivariate random fields with any number of components" by Apanasovich, Genton, and Sun (2012).

2. Simultaneous variable selection and estimation of the fixed effects (i.e. land-use regression variables) and the spatiotemporal random effects. The method is described in the paper "Scalable penalized spatiotemporal land-use regression for ground-level nitrogen dioxide" by Messier and Katzfuss (2020).

3. Censored outcomes using the Tobit likelihood and imputation via the EM algorithm. 

4. And as always, scalability of the Gaussian Process via the General Vecchia approximation as described in the paper "A general framework for Vecchia approximations of Gaussian processes" by Katzfuss and Guinness (2021).
